It has been said that the mouth is the gateway to your overall health. Not properly taking
care of your teeth and gums can lead to a variety of health problems. The main intention behind
this project is to provide online oral health services and information that can help people in
both pre and post-treatment conditions.
DENTOR is an android application where the customers can search for the services
provided, book their appointments and consult doctors through video conferencing. Additionally,
they can chat with patients and doctors through this DENTOR app. They receive email on
successful booking of an appointment.
The goal of this is to promote good oral health for people of all ages within the
community.
